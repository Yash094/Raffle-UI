 ## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**Use of the Raffle Application**

This Raffle Application is intended solely for educational and testing purposes. Users should be aware of the inherent risks associated with interacting with smart contracts, as the underlying contract may have vulnerabilities that could result in financial losses. The smart contract has not undergone a formal security audit, and users are advised to exercise caution, conduct thorough testing, and refrain from deploying it on the mainnet without adequate testing. Users assume full responsibility for their actions, and the creators and contributors of this application disclaim any liability for potential risks, financial losses, or damages incurred by users.

Always exercise caution and best practices when dealing with smart contracts, especially in a production environment.
